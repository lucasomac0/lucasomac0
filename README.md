# Hi there, I'm Lucas Macedo! 👋

I am a **Computer Science** student at Santa Catarina State University (**UDESC**) and an **Undergraduate Researcher** focused on High-Performance Computing (HPC).

Currently, my main focus is solving complex infrastructure and optimization problems by bridging Graph Theory with Artificial Intelligence.

### 🔭 Current Research Project

**Title:** Queue Management and Scheduling with Machine Learning Aid

I am working on the orchestration of computational environments, specifically investigating queue management and task selection strategies.

* **Objectives:** To prepare, organize, orchestrate, and schedule task queues with the assistance of Machine Learning.
* **Methodology:** My work involves studying the state-of-the-art, developing computational prototypes to deepen theoretical knowledge, and implementing a formal proposal for analysis.
* **Strategic Areas:** Cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT).
* **Core Skills:** Resource Management (Task Orchestration), AI & ML Techniques, System Optimization.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

My toolbelt has evolved to focus on data, simulation, and performance:

* **Languages:** Python (Current focus), C, C++, Java, SQL.
* **Data Science & AI:** PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, NetworkX.
* **HPC & Infra:** Linux, Docker, Slurm, Network Simulation.
* **Others:** Arduino (Instructor for workshops), Git, HTML/CSS.

### ⚡ Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not compiling code or training neural networks, you'll probably find me:

* 🎸 **Playing Guitar:** I'm passionate about classic tones (huge **Gary Moore** fan!) and I enjoy recording covers in my free time.
* 💪 **At the Gym:** Testing workout algorithms (currently replacing Scott Curls with Bayesian Curls 🏋️‍♂️).
* 📚 **Reading:** Currently studying scheduling algorithms and papers on GNN architectures.
